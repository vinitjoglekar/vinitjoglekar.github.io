# Everything Must Be Paid for Twice

These are my notes from [Everything Must Be Paid for Twice](https://www.raptitude.com/2022/01/everything-must-be-paid-for-twice/).

Most of the things we buy have to be paid for twice. The first price is the money we pay just to gain possession of the desired thing - typically some physical object such as a book; but it could also be something intangible such as a subscription to a blog, or just the right to use something. However, to actually use the thing, you must also pay a second price - the time, effort and initiative required to gain its benefits, and it can be much higher than the first price.

For example, a book might require Rs.500 for its first price - and ten hours of dedicated reading time for its second. Only after the second price is paid do you see any return on the first one. Paying only the first price is about the same as throwing the money in the garbage.
