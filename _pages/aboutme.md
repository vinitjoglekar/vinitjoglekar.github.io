# What is programming?
### A Plain English Explanation

If a genie appears before you and grants you 3 wishes, what would you ask? 

Take a minute to think about it, and then read on.

Well... I would ask this:
- Wish #1 - Please grant me 100 wishes --- Now I have 102 wishes remaining. 
- Wish #2 - Please keep track of my remaining wishes --- Now I have 101 wishes remaining, and the genie will keep track of the number for me.
- Wish #3 - Whenever the number of remaining wishes becomes less than 10, please ask from yourself, for and on my behalf, to grant me 100 wishes --- Now I have an auto-recharge facility set up with the genie!

That's programming in action!

**Programming is the art of exploiting any entity which can take and obey instructions.** So you can program genies, humans, animals, and computers too. Legal contracts, and the law itself, are an attempt to program human behavior. Influencing a person is a softer attempt to achieve the same end. The good (and the bad) thing about computers is that they always obey the instructions to the letter &mdash; nothing more, and nothing less! A computer won't attempt to find a loophole in the given instructions, nor will it fill in for any upspoken expectations. This deterministic behavior is what makes a computer reliable, and at the same time creates space for a profession called "programmer" &mdash; a person whose job is to draft precise, unambiguous instructions with nothing left unsaid.
